Game Rules: This is a two player game, that takes attention and concentration. Cards get randomly placed face down on the grid board. Then each player takes a turn by selecting two cards that turn over. If the cards match, then the player keeps them. If they don't match, the cards turn back over, and the next player goes. If the player gets a match, they get to go again, until they fail to get a match. The player with the most cards wins.
